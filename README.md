# Artist recommendation engine for Spotify: playlist generator ðŸŽ§

This project is a Python-based tool which generates a Spotify playlist with personalized artist recommendations based on user's listening history. 

It connects user's top artists data with the more comprehensive MusicBrainz dataset, to fetch similar artists for each favourite, before returning to Spotify API to extract each recommended artist's top song and output as a Spotify playlist added to user's library.
