# Artist recommendation engine for Spotify: playlist generator ðŸŽ§

This project is a Python-based tool which generates a Spotify playlist with personalized artist recommendations. 

It connects user's top Spotify artists data with the more comprehensive MusicBrainz/ListenBrainz dataset, to fetch similar artists for each artist on user's list. ListenBrainz's similar artist designation is based on additional artists listened to by other users who also play the original seed artist in the same session. Subsequently the tool returns to Spotify API to extract each recommended artist's top song as a sample of their work and outputs a Spotify playlist, automatically added to user's library.

## Features
* Fetches user's top 100 artists from Spotify API
* Maps Spotify artist IDs to MusicBrainz IDs (MBID) by extracting Spotify ID from free streaming links within artist url table [(Schema)](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database/Schema%23Artist#Overview)
    * CSV output of 100-artist longlist with MBID, Spotify ID: 'artists_with_mbids.csv'
* Extracts similar artists for user's top 50 artists using the ListenBrainz API
* References similar artists against original 100-artist longlist to remove existing artists
* Fetches top song for every recommended artist remaining as a sample of their work
    * CSV output of list of similar artists and tracks with Spotify IDs: 'similar_artists_results.csv'
* Creates Spotify playlist with top tracks from recommended artists
* Spotify playlist "Recommended artists ðŸŽ§" added to user's Spotify library

* Set up a .env file in the project root with your Spotify API credentials:
```text
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token
```
